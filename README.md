# Cryptocurrencies

In this project, we took different crypto currencies who all fit the criteria: 
    1. Must have coins mined.
    2. Must be Trading.
    3. Have a speicfied algorithm.
    4. No missing data (NaN).
We scaled this data and created a elbow curve using the KMeans to find out how many clusters we should use. WE then did a PCA exercise, built a 3D px.scatter plot, hvplot table and hvplot scatter graph.
